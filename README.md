DL Excerises 24

This repo contains the Deep learning framework as tought in the couse "Deep Learning" WS24/25. In this framwroks I have implemented:
  - Excercise 0: Data Preprocessing 
  - Excercise 1: Fully connected layer with numpy, sckit
  - Excercise 2: CNN with numpy, sckit
  - Excercise 3: RNN and LSTM with numpy, sckit
  - Excercise 4: Resnet based CNN with pytorch

Also contains the Resnet Based CNN model for solar panel crack detection.
